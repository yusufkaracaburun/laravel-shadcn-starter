# Wayfinder Vite Plugin

Vite plugin for [Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder).

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        wayfinder(),

All options have sensible defaults, but should you need to customize anything:

```ts

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        wayfinder({
            path: "my/custom/path/to/js",
            command: "herd php artisan wayfinder:generate",
            routes: false,
            actions: true,
            formVariants: false,
            patterns: ["resources/**/myroutes/*.php"],
        }),
        // ...
    ],
});
