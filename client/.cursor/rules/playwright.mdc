# Playwright Rules for Test Files

## Locator Strategy (MANDATORY)

When writing Playwright tests, always follow this locator selection strategy for stability, readability, and maintainability:

1. **Prefer `getByTestId()`**  
   - Always use `data-testid` attributes and Playwright’s `getByTestId()` (or equivalent) as your first choice for interacting with elements.
   - Add `data-testid` to UI components for critical actions, input fields, and assertions.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     await page.getByTestId('login-form_login_button').click()
     ```
2. **Only if `data-testid` is not available:**  
   - Use [Role selectors](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#role-selector) (e.g. `getByRole()`), or accessible labels with `getByLabel`, but prefer descriptive and unique roles/labels.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click()
     ```
3. **Avoid CSS selectors for user-visible elements**  
   - These are brittle and tie tests to implementation details. Only use for hidden/internal elements as a last resort.
4. **Do NOT use XPath**  
   - XPath selectors are discouraged and generally disallowed.
5. **Maintain accessibility**  
   - Ensure that the use of `data-testid` does not replace proper accessible labeling of UI elements.

Revisit and add `data-testid` to components as needed to allow for stable Playwright tests.
